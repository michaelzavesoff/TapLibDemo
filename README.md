# TapLibDemo

This GITHUB folder is filled with a few scripts from one of my projects "TapLib". The game is fully complete but cannot be released until it is finished being reviewed by "Universal Music Group" or "Universal Studios".

1. GameManager.cs - main script that runs the game for both players at a time using Update methods and IEnumerators. Tracks score using PlayerPrefs and creates a final win screen where the player earns IN-GAME currency used to buy songs and avatars.
2. Store.cs - small script that controls the store and allows players to buy the songs that they love.
3. Timer.cs - script that times the players and finds the length of the song using String formatting and timeScale.
